                            <p>I have held multiple jobs throughout high school and college taking care of children part-time and full-time. I've cared for children between the ages of 1 and 13, preparing meals and snacks, ensuring safe transportation to and from school and extracurricular activities, and making sure the children had activities to occupy them during their free time. My most recent job was a full-time position nannying for two children ages 4 and 7.</p>
